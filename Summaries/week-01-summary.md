Phase: Foundations

## What I actually completed

- Practiced basic Git and filesystem commands.

## Where I felt confident

- Basic terminal navigation and file operations.

## What was hardest or still fuzzy
- Occasional Git messages and verifying remote state.
- Confirming README accurately mirrors current structure.

## Concrete thing I built or configured
- A working Git + GitHub documentation pipeline with Week 1 notes and summary.

## What I will review next week
